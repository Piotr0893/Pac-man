# Pac-man
What started as a simple few second animation, turned into 60 second animation made only with pure CSS and HTML. Because why use JS when you can take 20x times longer making it in CSS only? :)
Tried to use mostly transform and opacity not to trigger layout or paint unnecesary, but sometimes I had to change background colour.
